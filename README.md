# Hybrid-Overlay-for-Streaming
Simulation of a Fibonacci heap based hybrid overlay network for live streaming

Run:
python simulation.py
This will run the simulation and print the status once every 20 secs in stats.log

Bugs: 
1. Stops after some time (may be due to deadlock)
2. Writing too much junk to log file. Need to clean
